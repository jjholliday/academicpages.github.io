I am an assistant professor in the Department of Korean Language and Literature at Korea University, in Seoul, South Korea. I received my PhD in 2012 from the Department of Linguistics at the Ohio State University. Before coming to my current position in 2015, I worked for three years as a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Second Language Studies at Indiana University Bloomington.

My broad research interests are laboratory phonology, language acquisition, and Korean.
