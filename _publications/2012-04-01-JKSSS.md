This paper presents an acoustic analysis of the sibilant fricative productions of speakers in their 20s from Seoul and Daegu. It is often claimed that the tense Korean fricative /s*/ is realized as an unaspirated fricative /s/ in Gyeongsang varieties, but I did not find any evidence to support this claim. The speakers from Daegu made just as clear a contrast as the speakers from Seoul did.
